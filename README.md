Unfortunately, these links are set to view only. You would have to clone the cells into your own google colab to edit and run the cells. To do so, click on 
```File > Save a copy in Drive...``` and open it from your google drive.

During the first run of the code, you will need to uncomment the first code block containing ```!pip install...```, and **only** run the first code block.
After doing so, you will have to wait for ~2 minutes before colab prompts you to restart the session. After restarting your
session, recomment the ```!pip install...```, and click on ```Runtime > Run all``` or ```Ctrl + F9``` to run all cell blocks.
